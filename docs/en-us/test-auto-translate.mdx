# Test Document for Auto-Translation

This is a basic test document created to verify that the auto-translation workflow is functioning correctly. It serves as a comprehensive example to validate the translation process and ensure proper handling of documentation updates.

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to:

- Test the auto-translation workflow
- Verify that English content gets translated to Japanese
- Ensure the workflow processes MDX files properly
- Validate that front matter is updated correctly

## Sample Content

### Introduction

This document contains simple English text that should be translated to Japanese when the auto-translation workflow runs.

### Features to Test

1. **Basic text translation**: Simple sentences and paragraphs
2. **List formatting**: Numbered and bulleted lists
3. **Headers**: Different header levels (H1, H2, H3)
4. **Front matter**: Metadata at the top of the file
5. **MDX components**: Basic MDX syntax

### Technical Details

The auto-translation workflow should:

- Detect changes to files in `docs/en-us/` directory
- Process `.md` and `.mdx` files
- Translate content using Claude Code AI
- Generate Japanese versions in `docs/ja-jp/` directory
- Preserve formatting and structure

### Sample Paragraphs

Here are some sample paragraphs with different types of content:

**Simple paragraph**: This is a basic paragraph with straightforward English text that should translate well into Japanese.

**Technical paragraph**: The GitHub Actions workflow uses Claude Code AI to automatically translate documentation from English to Japanese, maintaining the original formatting and structure while ensuring high-quality translations.

**Mixed content**: This paragraph contains both technical terms like "API", "workflow", and "repository" as well as common English phrases that need proper translation context.

## Expected Results

After the workflow runs, we should see:

- A new file created at `docs/ja-jp/test-auto-translate.mdx`
- Japanese translation of all text content
- Preserved MDX structure and formatting
- Updated front matter with Japanese metadata

## Conclusion

This test document provides a simple but comprehensive test case for the auto-translation workflow. It includes various types of content and formatting that should help verify the workflow's functionality.
