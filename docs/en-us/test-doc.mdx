# Test Documentation

This is a basic test document to verify our auto-translation workflow is working correctly. It contains various content types and formatting elements to thoroughly test the translation capabilities.

## Overview

This document contains simple content that can be easily translated to test our Claude Code Action setup.

## Features

Our auto-translation workflow provides:

- **Automatic translation** when documentation PRs are merged
- **Manual translation** via `@claude translate docs` comments
- **Format preservation** for all MDX elements
- **Professional Japanese** output

## Code Example

Here's a simple code block that should remain in English:

```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
  return "This code should stay in English";
}
```

## Lists

### Ordered List
1. First item - this should be translated
2. Second item - this should be translated
3. Third item - this should be translated

### Unordered List
- Feature A - automatic detection
- Feature B - high quality translation
- Feature C - format preservation

## Links and References

Check out our [main documentation](../README.md) for more information.

Visit [GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) for workflow details.

## Summary

This test document helps verify that our auto-translation workflow can:

1. Detect changes to English documentation files
2. Create corresponding Japanese translations
3. Preserve all formatting and structure
4. Handle code blocks, links, and lists correctly

If you see a Japanese translation of this file in `docs/ja-jp/test-doc.mdx`, the workflow is working perfectly!
